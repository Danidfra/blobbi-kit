/**
 * Development/test accessory fixtures: THREE tiny local SVGs and the plain
 * data that places them.
 *
 * These exist because verifying the renderer's accessory pipeline should not
 * require an authenticated session, a relay, an inventory event, or a
 * production item definition. They are:
 *
 *  - never published to Nostr;
 *  - never inserted into anyone's inventory;
 *  - never implicitly equipped;
 *  - passed explicitly, as plain data, by whoever renders them.
 *
 * They are real IMAGE files rather than emoji or text on purpose: the renderer
 * paints accessories through `<img src>`, so an image fixture exercises the
 * production path: the candidate-source list, the `onError` fallback walk, the
 * transform stack: where a text glyph would exercise none of it.
 *
 * Between them the three cover every rendering behavior worth checking:
 *
 * | fixture      | slot       | exercises                                  |
 * | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
 * | `cape`       | `back`     | behind-body layer, flipX, rear-view SURVIVAL |
 * | `goggles`    | `eyewear`  | front layer, rotation, rear-view HIDING    |
 * | `starBadge`  | `headwear` | front layer, scale, x/y placement          |
